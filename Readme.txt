I have spent weeks racking my brain for different applicational uses of JavaScript.
This particular website would have almost no need of any that I can think of. So in the interest of time,
I'm going to submit this project and add more functions as they come to me

This project was to functionally test my application of bootstrap and serve as a light intro to JavaScript
While it was requested that I maintain the scripts separately, curiosity killed the cat and I wanted to know that my scripts actually worked.

During this project I was incapacitated for about two weeks and admittedly it threw me off. I feel like a lot of what I have learned has fallen off a little bit so after submission I will need to re study JavaScript from the beginning

Now then,

This site is an homage to my original music portfolio website, as such, both in aesthetic and in site functions I've tried to be as connected to that old design philosophy as possible. While I much would've preferred my custom css without bootstrap, for this project it was required and thus a separate file will be created to that affect merely to maintain my aesthetic preferences
